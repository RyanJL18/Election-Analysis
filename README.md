# Election Analysis 
## Overview
 The purpose of this project was to analyize and identify amounts of votes for the US Congressional Race in Colorado. Given the data provided, we needed to count votes based on candidate choice, district, and totals for each category. With this information we were able to determine the winner for the Congressional Race. Below are the results based on the total number of votes, county votes, and candidate votes with the final section addressing the election winner.
# Election Results
**Total Votes Cast: 369,711**

The total votes cast for these three counties was 396,711 while the population is estimated to be 1,945,047 based on the information provided through google as of the 2019 consensus in these areas. Only 19.1% of the total population of these three counties participated in their local election. This feels like a very small percentage, but a division of these two numbers does not offer the whole picture as not all people within a given population are eligible to vote.
